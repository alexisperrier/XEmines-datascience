# Time vs Frequency domain: Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up. A Fourier transform takes a time series or a function of continuous time, and maps it into a frequency spectrum.

# Exponential weighted moving average
Introduce a Decay

The EWMA for a series Y may be calculated recursively:

* \\( S\_{1}=Y\_{1} \\)
* \\(      t&gt;1, \ \ S\_{t}=\alpha \cdot Y\_{t}+(1-\alpha )\cdot S\_{t-1} \\)


Where:

* The coefficient α represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher α discounts older observations faster.
* Yt is the value at a time period t.
* St is the value of the EWMA at any time period t.

# Auto Correlation

A measure of how much is the current value influenced by the previous values in a time series.

Autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between lagged values of a time series.

</section>

<section data-markdown="">

# Partial Auto Correlation

Let's say you have a TS with a high correlation 1 sample apart

* 1) \\( Y\_{n+1}  \\) very correlated with \\( Y\_{n}  \\)
* 2) \\( Y\_{n}  \\) very correlated with \\( Y\_{n-1}  \\)
* etc ...

That correlation impacts the correlation between samples  that are further apart

* \\( Y\_{n+1}  \\) appears very correlated with \\( Y\_{n-1}  \\) since 1_ and 2)

The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) can be thought of as the correlation between two points that are separated by some number of periods n, BUT with the effect of the intervening correlations removed.

The PACF removes the intervening correlation between the samples

# Properties: Stationarity

The concept of **stationarity** is very important in modeling non-independent data

Many results which holds for independent random variables (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, ...) hold for stationary random variables.


A time serie is said to be stationnary if

* **Constant mean**: The mean of the series should not be a function of time rather should be a constant.

* **Constant variance**: Homoscedasticity: The variance of the series should not a be a function of time.

* **Fix lagged covariance**: The covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should only depend on i and not m.

# Stationarity test

* Dickey-Fuller Test: This is one of the statistical tests for checking stationarity.
* Here the null hypothesis is that the TS is non-stationary.

* The test results comprise of a Test Statistic and some Critical Values for difference confidence levels.

* If the ‘Test Statistic’ is less than the ‘Critical Value’, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the series is stationary.

    For instance: the Dickey-Fuller test statistic is less than the 10% critical value, thus the TS is stationary with 90% confidence.

</section>

<section data-markdown="">
# Dickey Fuller test

* from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
* dftest = adfuller(timeseries, autolag='AIC')

Returns: ['Test Statistic','p-value','#Lags Used','Number of Observations Used']

# How to make a TS stationary
There are 2 major reasons behind non-stationarity of a TS:

1. Trend – varying mean over time. On average, the number of passengers was growing over time.

2. Seasonality – variations at specific time-frames. eg people might have a tendency to buy cars in a particular month because of pay increment or festivals.

So remove trend and seasonality and apply prediction on resulting TS

</section>

<section data-markdown="">
# Trend

Estimating &amp; Eliminating Trend

One of the first tricks to reduce trend can be transformations such as log, square root, cube root, etc. Lets take a log transform here for simplicity:

### Notebook

* Load the [Monthly milk production](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22sn/monthly-milk-production-pounds-per-cow-jan-62-dec-75-adjusted-for-month-length#!ds=22sn&amp;display=line) dataset
* Fit a linear regression line
* Remove Moving Average
* Fit a linear regression line
* plot before after

</section>

<section data-markdown="">
# Differencing
Differencing – taking the difference with a particular time lag

One of the most common methods of dealing with both trend and seasonality is differencing. In this technique, we take the difference of the observation at a particular instant with that at the previous instant. This mostly works well in improving stationarity.

</section>

<section data-markdown="">
# Decomposing
Both trend and seasonality are modeled separately

        from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
        decomposition = seasonal_decompose(ts_log)

        trend = decomposition.trend
        seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
        residual = decomposition.resid

        # Then plot
        plt.subplot(411)
        plt.plot(ts_log, label='Original')
        plt.legend(loc='best')
        plt.subplot(412)
        plt.plot(trend, label='Trend')
        plt.legend(loc='best')
        plt.subplot(413)
        plt.plot(seasonal,label='Seasonality')
        plt.legend(loc='best')
        plt.subplot(414)
        plt.plot(residual, label='Residuals')
        plt.legend(loc='best')
        plt.tight_layout()

# Transformations
https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/4

* Mathematical: Box plot
* Calendar Adjustments
    monthly milk production on a farm,

* Population adjustments
    per 1000
    you remove the effect of population changes by considering number of beds per thousand people
* Inflation adjustments
        for money related series
         a price index is used. If ztzt denotes the price index and ytyt denotes the original house price in year tt, then xt=yt/zt∗z2000xt=yt/zt∗z2000 gives the adjusted house price at year 2000 dollar values. Price indexes are often constructed by government agencies. For consumer goods, a common price index is the Consumer Price Index (or CPI).

# Residuals

A good forecasting method will yield residuals with the following properties:

* The residuals are uncorrelated. If there are correlations between residuals, then there is information left in the residuals which should be used in computing forecasts.

* The residuals have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than zero, then the forecasts are biased.

In addition to these essential properties, it is useful (but not necessary) for the residuals to also have the following two properties.

* The residuals have constant variance.

* The residuals are normally distributed.

Look at

* Histograms of residuals
* QQ plots
* ACF of the residuals
* Box-Pierce test
* Ljung-Box
