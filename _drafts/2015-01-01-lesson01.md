  # Roles in Data Science

  !["roles in Data Science"](/assets/01/roles.png)

</section>

<section data-markdown>

  # Difference between:

  * **Data Analysis**, **Data Mining**:  explore and find trends, anomalies and correlations.
    * DA: focuses on a subset
    * DM: looks at all the data (90's)
  * **Statistics**: Finding the best model that fits the data
  * **Machine learning**: The Math and the Algorithms.

    The model learns (auto-tunes) from the data
  * **Predictive analytics**: Build models that can predict from past data
  * **Data science**: All that and more

# A tiny drop of History

Great article [Forbes: A Very Short History Of Data Science](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/#bbea13569fd2)

2001 Leo Breiman, Berkeley, publishes “[Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726)”:

“*There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models.*

*This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.*”

<section data-markdown>
# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

* A methodology for doing Data Science

* Similar to the scientific method

* Helps produce reliable and reproducible results
    * **Reliable**:  Accurate findings
    * **Reproducible**:  Others can follow your steps and get the same results

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

6 steps

1. **Identify** the Business Problem
2. **Acquire** Raw Data
3. **Parse and Mine** the Data: **data munging**
4. **Transform** the data: Feature engineering
5. **Select** and tune the Model: **Model Selection** and **Feature Selection**
6. **Present/ implement the results**: Visualization, deploy to production

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 1: **Identify** the Business Problem

* Identify Business or Product objectives,
* Identify and Hypothesize Goals
* Define Success Metrics,
* Find the right datasets

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 2: **Acquire** Raw Data

* Availability and Timeliness

* Security and Privacy

* Relevance, Bias, Sampling methods

* Sources: 3rd party platforms, in house, public data

* Heterogeneity: databases, files (csv, pdf), 3rd Party, API, ...

* Tools: 3rd party (Informatica, Jitterbit), scripts, spreadsheets, ...

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 3: Parse and Mine aka Data Munging

### Understand
* Documentation, Data dictionnaries

### Explore
* Perform exploratory surface analysis via filtering, sorting
* Exploratory Statistics and Visualizations
* Distribution? Trends? Outliers?

### Clean

* Format and clean data in Python (dates, number signs, formatting)
* Invalid values
* Missing values, imbalanced sets, normalization

</section>

<section data-markdown>

# Step 4: Feature engineering

### Create new variables to gain more insights, more signal from the data

For instance

* Date time Features: Number of days before event, week #, season, holiday, evening vs morning
* Combine, multiply, polynomial, log, inverse, ...
* Group by pattern
* Use domain knowledge
* One Hot Encoding
* Remove features to strengthen good features

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# ETL

Steps 3,4 are called ETL:  [Extract Transform Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)

Evolved from batch processing in data warehouse environments

Creating the final dataset on which to apply models

* Combine
* Clean
* Complement
* Create

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

* What's a model?
* What's the simplest model?

</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

What's a model?

One or a combination of algorithms

* Trained to the data
* With optimized parameters

Threshold, [Linear Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)

Note:
see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Step 5: Model Selection

* Select the appropriate type of models for the task: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Outlier Detection, ...

# Example: The Online Retail Data Set  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

[The Online Retail Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#)

**Problem Statement**:  *Using customer , determine how likely previous customers are to request a repeat delivery using*

* Order history
* Shopping carts composition
* Demographic data

Classic [RFM model](http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/RFM-analysis): Recency, Frequency, Monetary

We can use the Data Science workflow to work through this problem.

</section>


<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail:  1) Identify the Problem

* Identify the business/product objectives.
* Identify and hypothesize goals and criteria for success.
* Create a set of questions to help you identify the correct data set.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 2) Identify and Acquire the Data

* Ideal data vs. data that is available
* What data is available for this example? Limitations?
* What kind of questions might we want to ask about the data?

**Questions to ask about the data**

* Is there enough data?
* Does it appropriately align with the question/problem statement?
* Can the dataset be trusted?  How was it collected?
    * Secondary data = we didn’t directly collect it ourselves
* Is this dataset aggregated / grouped?  Can we use the aggregation or do we need to get it pre-aggregated?

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 3) Parse, Explore and Mine the Data

1. Let's read the [Data dictionary](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#)
2. First look
3. Load the data in a Notebook start exploring
4. Outliers? Valid Data?
5. Format and clean the data
6. Any missing values?
7. Normalize?

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 3) Explore in Python

Open a new Notebook and follow along:

[Jupyter Notebook: Exploration of the online retail dataset](https://github.com/alexperrier/gads/blob/master/01_what_is_a_data_scientist/py/L1%20Online%20Retail.ipynb)

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 4) Feature Engineering


* Extract meaning and classes from product descriptions
* Define Categories
* Cancelled order
* Total amount per order
* Total amount per Customer, Country, Day ....
* Special Days: Holidays, week ends,
* One hot Encoding

=> Potential for hundreds, throusands of features

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 5) Model

* Find types of customers: Simple clustering
* Predict retention: Random Forests, Logistic Regression, ...
* Similarity between UK customers and Non UK

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 5) Model

The steps for model building are

* Select the appropriate model
* Build the model
* Evaluate and refine the model
* Predict outcomes and action items

=> back to step 2 (more data, other data), 3 (more cleanup), 4 (Add / Remove Features)

</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 6) Present the Results

* You have to effectively communicate your results for them to matter!
* Ranges from a simple email to a complex web graphic.
* Make sure to consider your audience.
* A presentation for fellow data scientists will be drastically different from a presentation for an executive.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Online Retail: 6) Present the Results

Key factors of a good presentation include

* Summarize findings with narrative and storytelling techniques

* Refine your visualizations for broader comprehension

* Present both limitations and assumptions

* Determine the integrity of your analyses

* Consider the degree of disclosure for various stakeholders

* Test and evaluate the effectiveness of your presentation beforehand
