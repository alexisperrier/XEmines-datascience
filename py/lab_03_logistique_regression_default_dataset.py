'''
Load the iris dataset and Boxplot the petal length and the petal width
Write a simple function that returns 0 or 2 depending on the Petal length and a threshold
Write a function that returns the ratio of properly predicted samples vs the total number of samples
For different thresholds calculate the number of estimated positives (1s) over the true number of samples in that class
What happens to the accuracy if you were to look at sepal length for your simple classifier? Try it.

How would you use this simple classifier to expand to 3 classes
